## Lightweight Convolutional Neural Networks for Brain Tumor Segmentation

### BUGS

* Tensor input shape is not correct for final 1x1x1 convolutional layer

### TODOs

* Add data folder (download BRaTS 2020 dataset)
* Add operational training script
* Add TensorBoard support
* Take care of local CUDA support (will work fine in colab)
